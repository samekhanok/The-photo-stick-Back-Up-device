## The PhotoStick iOS Android: Back Up Your Photos!

At least once in our lives, we have all been victims of the “Storage is full” warning, warning that our smartphones flash whenever our gallery is full of precious photos and videos. Well, let's be honest. Some of us come across this message daily in a real battle with the lack of device space. [editor on GitHub](https://www.holgadirect.com/photo-stick-review/)

These photos captured important events of our lives and saving these files to computers or external hard drives… well

Lucky for you, we live in a time when anything is possible, even things like iOS photo backup (plus videos) in a jiffy. So you can be happy and say hello to Photo Stick Mobile for iPhone and Android. In this review of [ThePhotoStick](https://www.holgadirect.com/photo-stick-review/) Mobile, we'll look at how this revolutionary (and truly amazing) device will do in terms of media storage.

# What is ThePhotoStick Mobile?

ThePhotoStick Mobile can be considered one of those ultimate symbols of convenience and organization packed into a small USB device that fits in the palm of your hand. Too many adjectives - and I think he deserves it.

With this tool, you don't have to connect your phone to a laptop to back up your files (even with web applications making this process easier, it's still boring). With this tool all photos and videos of your travels, parties and random moments will be saved with just one click - no additional hardware needed. This is a good way to prevent your photos and videos from being physically damaged.

The device acts as a small USB flash drive for iPhone and Android, where you can easily store your photos. With ThePhotoStick Mobile, you don't have to transfer files from your phone to a cloud backup or an external drive.

Best of all, we're not just talking about a storage tool, but also a digital organizer. We can say goodbye to the days you need to manually sort your photos, because it also automatically finds and removes duplicates.

## Tipping Myths About PhotoStick iOs Android

Let's say you are still not convinced that you should abandon external (often complex and clumsy) drives and unsubscribe from your cloud backup account. In this commentary section of PhotoStick Mobile for iPhone and Android, we answer some of the most common objections and hope to shed some light on most of your photo and video storage issues.

## “I can just back up myself so I don't need that.”

Of course, you can back up your photos and videos yourself. There is no problem with that. It's really nice to worry about backing up your files. But our point is that if you have the practice of backing up, it would take a lot more time going through each file and transferring it to another storage device.

It can also become confusing (we are often talking about hundreds or thousands of files) and you could lose a big picture or video because of the huge amount of files you need to rate. It may also happen that you duplicate some files yourself that would take up some much needed space. Another thing: What if your computer crashes in the middle of a transfer? You risk losing all your progress and getting back exactly where you started. It is very counterproductive and time consuming.

The essence of ThePhotoStick Mobile for iPhone and Android is to do the dirty work for you so you can spend your time on what really matters, whether it's studying, watching shows, movies, reading or staying on Instagram. Let's take another look at the issues you may encounter if you try to back up your iOS and Android photo files:

    If you do this yourself, you will need to go through all the files and send them to a backup device. This can lead to confusion and you may lose an important photo or video due to the large amount of files you need to rate.
    You can accidentally duplicate files and take up some much needed space.
    Your computer may crash. You risk losing all your progress and getting back exactly where you started. It is very counterproductive and time consuming.

ThePhotoStick Mobile is a gadget that makes your life easier in many ways and with just one device. It's an iOS flash drive for iPhone and Android, and it is compatible with PCs that also run on Windows and Mac. But you don't need to use many devices to store your files, just one phone is needed.

## “It looks like a regular USB drive. What makes it so efficient?

From the outside, ThePhotoStick Mobile looks just like any other USB OTG device. But don't judge this quickly because, although it may seem like a simple flash drive, it is actually powered internally by very sophisticated software.

## ThePhotoStick Mobile uses software that lets you quickly search, store and organize all your photos and videos.

You do not need to do any system setup before uploading photos and videos. Because of its accessibility and convenience, it is considered the best flash drive for iPhone and Android.
“I can use cloud backup so I don't have to load a physical device.”

True, but cloud backup turns out to be more expensive than this device in a short time. Cloud backup from large companies is not free and if you want a large storage capacity then you will have to pay a monthly or annual fee. Also, you will need an internet connection whenever you want to backup iOS photo and videos.

Another disadvantage of cloud backup is the amount of effort required when uploading files. If you are uploading a large volume of photos and videos, this can be very time consuming. You also have to manually select the files you want to upload.

With PhotoStick Mobile, you only need to pay once for your device and you're done. It's also hassle-free because you can back up your files in just one click and require no logins.
